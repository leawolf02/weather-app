You can easily search for any location in my weather app using the search bar. After entering a city or place, the app displays the current weather conditions and temperature for that location. Alternatively, you can use your device's location services to instantly access accurate local weather information without typing anything.

The app provides flexible unit settings, allowing you to switch between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin at any time. This feature is convenient for users from different regions or with different scientific preferences.

The app offers a detailed 3-hour interval weather forecast for forecasting, giving you a clear picture of how conditions will change throughout the day. A full 5-day forecast is also available to help you plan ahead.

At the bottom of the interface, you will find a 24-hour weather chart. This graph displays two types of data, such as temperature and another weather metric, over the next 24 hours. This visual representation makes it easier to understand short-term weather trends and see how conditions are expected to develop.
